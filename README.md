Glory is a web app created to allow users to upload their lifts to a personal database and see how they progress over time. Glory has several features and filters which allow users to get the most relevant data possible and uses graphs and tables to display this data to the user. 

## Installation

Install relevant dependencies in both the client folder and the server folder.

```bash
npm install
```
Initialize front-end react app and back-end express.js server.

```bash
# In client folder run:
npm start

# In server folder run:
npm run dev
```
Build application.
```bash
# In client folder run:
npm run build
```

## Usage

Users can create an account, authenticated through firebase's authentication system, and begin logging their lifts, which are then stored in firebase's firestore database.
